# Development
#### 4/9/2019
Created Proposal and started testing out libraries. Messed around with the ofxGUI library in snake and tried to add other addons to a new openframeworks project.<br/>
##### To Do:<br/>
Will test out creating random graphs and using the basic graphics library.<br/>
Problems:
1. Confused on how to add external libraries to a new openframeworks project.<br/>
#### 4/11/2019
Figured out how to add addons. Testing out ofxGraph. Just trying to create a basic graph and save it using ofApp update().<br/>
##### To Do:<br/>
Will begin creating a map for the algorithms to run through.<br/>
Problems:
1. Compile errors, cannot project a graph using ofxGraph properly.<br/>
#### 4/16/2019
Resolved graph issue. Begining project! Creating a single mini-problem for the bots to go through. Following of-snake style..<br/>
##### To Do:<br/>
spruce up map to make it look nice<br/>
add myTest to github so I can commit stuff<br/>
Problems:
1. Cannot add my project to github.<br/>
#### 4/17/2019
Resolved git tracking issue. Creating a single mini-problem for the bots to go through. Following of-snake style..<br/>
##### To Do:<br/>
spruce up map to make it look nice<br/>
add myTest to github so I can commit stuff<br/>
Problems:
1. I'm an idiot.<br/>
#### 4/18/2019
Added a pretty background, obstacle and a random bot.<br/>
##### To Do:<br/>
create a helper class to give bot information about the obstacle.<br/>
Problems:
1. The obstacle isn't moving the way I want to. For now, this isn't a big issue.<br/>
#### 4/24/2019
Got random bot to move around the screen in random directions..<br/>
created a helper class to give bot information about the obstacle, called game engine class. The class kills the bot when it hits the bottom.<br/>
##### ToDo <br/>
Problems:
1. The program still moves the bot after it "dies" -- waste of space..<br/>
2. Need to get started on another bot and hopefully finish visuals by next code review.
