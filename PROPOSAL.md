<br />The above video and a fellow student named _Brian Furman_ are the inspiration for this project.
### Mission

...The mission for my project is to compare different types of AI algorithms, and see which ones are faster at solving a certain type of problem. From the minute background I have gained in CS 126 and CS 361, I believe that I have enough starting materials to discover more types of AI algorithms and being able to implement them into my design. At the end, the time it took for each algorithm to solve the problem will be displayed. The types of problems will vary to see which problems are more suited to be solved by a certain AI. It is like the visual of many different sorts that work fast on a particular type of list.

...In my graphics I will show the problem and the show the types of algorithms trying to reach the end goal. The end goal will be determined by a boolean, either a success, or a failure.

## Here are some of the types of problems:
| Problems      | Description          										|
| ------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Maze (WHG)    | Like the Youtube video I showed above, the Maze will have a start and an end, with walls. 	|
| Move Accross  | AI will simply move across the page, the most basic version					|
| Minigame      | This is the most complex of all the problems, and there will be a point system		|
